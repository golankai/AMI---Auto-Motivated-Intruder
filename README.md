# Auto Motivated Intruder (AMI)
Automatic Re-identifying tool


The burgeoning demand for expansive text data in social and medical research presents a challenge: while pressing questions necessitate using sensitive data, data protection and ethics raise a barrier.
A promising solution lies in automated text anonymization, which performs data masking of Personally Identifiable Information ("**PII**"), such as names and locations, at scale.
This work displays experiments on the topic, utilizing LLMs capabilities, as an off-the-shelf tool.

Until today, numerous studies illustrated that text can be anonymized with only minor performance degradation.
Nevertheless, this approach is not infallible, especially for sensitive sectors such as healthcare.
### How can we tell if our text is sufficiently anonymized?
The domain of text anonymization lacks a standardized evaluation method, rendering the challenge multifaceted and open to individual interpretation.
Traditionally, the most reliable evaluators have been humans attempting to re-identify individuals from anonymized texts, this process is called the \underline{Motivated Intruder Test}.
There are also some more technical metrics, such as the accuracy of tokens to be redacted, but again, this is prone to biases and personal interpretation.

### Aspiration
Our aspiration is to surpass human re-identification capabilities, thereby setting a new benchmark for evaluating anonymized data.
Namely, our approach can be used as an evaluation technique for other anonymization schemes, manual and automatic.

### Motivation
Our motivation is that a spontaneous re-identification process done by humans is indeed a threat, but in the world of Big Data, is not efficient and scalable.
An automated version is very likely what will be developed and used by a potential Adversary.

### Problem Statement:
- RQ1. Compete with humans in the task of re-identifying famous persons from anonymized texts.
- RQ2. Develop a new metric of the anonymization (/re-identification) rate of a single text.

We chose this problem as data collection and data protection are two very relevant and essential topics, and their convergence is not yet close to being fully discovered.
